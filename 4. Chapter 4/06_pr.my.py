#first question
# question.... Write a program to store seven fruits in a list entered by the user.

# list  =input ("enter first fruits 1\n")
# list1 =input ("enter first fruits 2\n")
# list2 =input ("enter first fruits 3\n")
# list3 =input ("enter first fruits 4\n")
# list4 =input ("enter first fruits 5\n")
# list5 =input ("enter first fruits 6\n")
# list6 =input ("enter first fruits 7\n")
# mylists=[list,list1,list2,list3,list4,list5,list6]
# print(mylists)



# second question 
# Write a program to accept marks of 6 students  and display them in a sorted manner.

# m1=int(input("enter obtained mark of student no 1\n" ))
# m2=int(input("enter obtained mark of student no 2\n" ))
# m3=int(input("enter obtained mark of student no 3\n" ))
# m4=int(input("enter obtained mark of student no 4\n" ))
# m5=int(input("enter obtained mark of student no 5\n" ))
# m6=int(input("enter obtained mark of student no 6\n" ))

# markshitofschool= [m1,m2,m3,m4,m5,m6]
# markshitofschool.sort()
# print(markshitofschool)


#third  question
# check that a tuple cannot be changed in python
# a=(1,2,3,4,6,)
# a[1]=12
# print(a)
#this program is showing error..this is proed that tuples can not be changed..

# (  ) this shows tuples.
# [  ]this shows list


#forth question
#write a program to sum a list with 4 numbers...

# l=[1,2,3,4,]
# sum=(l[0]+l[1]+l[2]+l[3])
# print(sum)
#2nd way
# print(sum(l))



#fifth question
#write program to count the number of zeros in the following type
a = (7,0,8,0,0,9)
print(a.count(0))
